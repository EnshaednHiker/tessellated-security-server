# Tessellated Security
Tessellated Security is an end-to-end service to take your own tessel 2 and a magnetic switch and build your own security system. Check out the main [Github repo here](https://github.com/EnshaednHiker/tessellated-security) for a detailed tutorial on how to use the service. 

For the DYI security afficionado, all inclusive code to run a server (Node/Express), webclient, database (MongoDB/Mongoose), and a [tessel](https://tessel.io/) hooked up to a [magnetic door switch](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13247).The project's server running here is hosted on Heroku while the database is on mLab.

## Server
The server at this time is currently hosted on Heroku. I used CircleCI for continuous integration testing. [Github repo for the server API for the service.](https://github.com/EnshaednHiker/tessellated-security-server) The database for the data layer is hosted on mLab
